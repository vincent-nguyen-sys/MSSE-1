With advancements in robotic and miniaturization techniques, HTS is capable of handling a high volume of thousands of tiny tests at once and in an automated fashion. In early stages of HTS, single-shot inhibition data provides a quick assessment of each compound’s activity against the target. A single concentration, which is relatively high to maximize the chance of detecting any inhibition, is selected. Each compound from a large library of compounds is tested at this concentration, and the inhibition of the target’s activity is measured. Compounds that exhibit significant inhibition at the single concentration are flagged as potential hits for follow-up studies.\n",

For example, the COVID Moonshot program determined IC50 from dose response curves that used an 11-point range of 100—0.0017 µM inhibitor concentrations, ensuring that both high and low efficacy could be measured.\n",

At a high-level, we start with initial guesses for the parameters in the Hill equation ($E_{max}$, $[I]$, $n$) and we iteratively adjust the parameters to minimize the error between the observed data points and the model’s predictions via a combination of gradient descent and the Gauss-Newton method.

        "\n",
        "The concept of creating representative sets of compounds is a critical strategy in the pharmaceutical industry. Consider a scenario where we have conducted a virtual screening campaign but have limited resources to experimentally test only a few compounds in a confirmatory assay. To maximize the information obtained from this screen, we select a diverse set of compounds. This might mean picking one representative from each chemical series in our list of potentially active compounds, ensuring that the selected compounds span the broadest range of chemical diversity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Alternatively, we might focus on a single chemical series to delve into the structure-activity relationship within that series. By systematically testing compounds within the same series, we can gain detailed insights into how small structural changes drive biological activity, thus informing future optimization and development efforts. When designing compound libraries, we strike a balance between diversity and focus:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Diversity, i.e., maximizing exploration: More structurally diverse libraries provide greater coverage over the expanse of chemical space that we want to explore, maximizing the number of compounds with different activities and minimizing the number of redundant compounds with similar activities. We place greater emphasis on diversity when we expect our compound library to be used to screen against a broad set of biological targets or when we don’t have much prior information about the therapeutic target of interest.\n",
        "  - Focus, i.e., maximizing exploitation: Focused libraries restrict our navigation of chemical space to a narrower region. We place greater emphasis on focused libraries when we know more about the downstream use case, incorporating as much information about the therapeutic target (such as its 3D structure, if available) to maximize our hit rate. Focused libraries provide higher hit rates, but these starting points may have greater redundancy in activity or function.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is not a single, authoritative definition or quantification of chemical diversity. There are many methods for assessing the internal diversity of the molecules in our library, as well as the diversity of those molecules compared to external data sets from prior screens. We can quantify diversity as a function of any molecular descriptors or scaffolds, and how we measure diversity will also impact how we sample which molecules are to be included in the library.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once we’ve settled on which descriptors we want to use to characterize our molecules and how we want to measure the aggregate diversity of the molecules we are considering, we can construct each subset of size K from the total number of molecules, N, that we are considering, measure each subset’s diversity, and keep the subset with greatest diversity. If we want to construct a library of 100 molecules from an initial set of 500 molecules, we’d need to evaluate ${N \\choose K}={500 \\choose 100}=2*10^{107}$ subsets. This is not realistic.\n",
        "\n",

Such data sources, typically large compound libraries, do not have to be pre-existing collections like the Specs library from lab 1. In the present, we’ll cover two classic approaches used to construct synthetic compound libraries, from which we can use as a basis to sample a diverse subset of compounds. If you find this subject interesting, you may want to explore the use of generative ML models to create synthetic compound libraries outside of this class.\n",

Compounds with the same scaffold often constitute a chemical series.\n",

Different R-groups can be attached to the same scaffold to create a library of analogs, which we can also use to explore how structural modifications to the compound affect its activity. This process is referred to as scaffold decoration.\n",
        "\n",
        "In some cases, fundamental flaws inherent to the scaffold core arise, such as toxicity or patentability concerns. Scaffold hopping involves identifying entirely new scaffolds that exhibit similar biological activity as our current scaffold, while obviating their limitations. Note that we exchange the entire scaffold of the molecule while preserving the R-groups that were originally attached to it. Searching for alternative, novel scaffolds is harder than just adjusting the R-groups. From a modeling perspective, we must also consider that models exposed only to compounds with the old scaffold may not translate to reliable predictions on compounds with the new scaffold.\n",
        "\n",
        "One application of scaffold hopping is to resolve intellectual property issues in drug repurposing. The original patent holders may have exclusive rights to the drug being repurposed, which can complicate IP ownership unless new patents for new indications can be obtained. If this interests you, check out Markush structures, which is a representation in chemical patents and IP claims that defines a broad class of chemical compounds by specifying variable parts of a molecule, allowing for the inclusion of multiple possible substituents or structural variations."

Problematically, histograms can change significantly depending on the number of intervals and the length of the intervals, resulting in different interpretations of the same data set.
